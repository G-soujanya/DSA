1. Full Binary Tree
A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.

2. Perfect Binary Tree
A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.
3. Complete Binary Tree
->Every level must be completely filled
->All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
->The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.
